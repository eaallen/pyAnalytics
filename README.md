### Functional Programming 
I hope we can build many python modules that will be able to speed up our data analysis on tests and the semester project.

When it comes to building python modules it will be extremely helpful to use functional programming basics which is that every function has an input and an output, with zero (0) manipulation of global variables. This will make it easier to debug and correct which will be essential for model success.   

### How to use mlr.py
```
#import master functions 
import sys, os
sys.path.append('c:\\path\\to\\local\\repo')
# Now do your import
import mlr
mlr.help()
```
